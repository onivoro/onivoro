SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
When using pressure cookers, basic safety precautions should always be followed.
1)   Do not touch hot surfaces of pressure cooker. Use side handles for carrying.
2)   Do not place the cooker on or near a hot gas or electric burner, or in a heated oven.
3)   Intended for countertop use only. 
4)   Do not use pressure cooker for anything other than intended use.
5)   Never deep fry or pressure fry in the cooker with oil.
6)   Do not let cord hang over edge of table or counter, or touch hot surfaces.
7)   Do not use cooker in electrical systems other than 110-120V~/60Hz for North America.
      
8)   Do not operate cooker with damaged cord or plug, or after the cooker malfunctions
       or has been damaged in any manner.
9)   Do not open the unit until the cooker has cooled and all internal pressure
      has been released. If the float valve is still up or the lid is difficult to turn, it is an 
      indication that the cooker is still pressurized -  do not force it open. 
      Please see “Getting Started” pages 12-14.
10) For all pressure cooking programs, the total amount of pre-cooked food and liquid in
      the inner pot should not pass the 2/3 line. When cooking food that expands during
      cooking such as rice, beans or vegetables, food should not pass the 1/2 line.
      Overfilling may risk clogging the steam release resulting in excess pressure. This may also
      cause leakage, personal injuries, or damage to the cooker. These fill level warnings do not
      apply to non-pressure cooking programs.
2

19) Be aware that certain foods, such as applesauce, cranberries, pearl barley, oatmeal or
       other cereals, split peas, noodles, macaroni, rhubarb, or spaghetti can foam, froth,
       sputter, and clog the steam release. These foods should not be cooked under
       pressure cooking settings unless as directed in Instant Pot
®
 cooker recipes.
20) Always check the steam release valve, float valve and anti-block shield for clogging
       before use.
21) Always make sure the sealing ring rack is completely set in the groove on the inside of 
       the sealing ring.
Important Safeguards

       appliance near these individuals.
13) Do not immerse the cooker base in water. To protect against electrical shock, do not   
       immerse the cord, power plug, or cooker in any liquid.
14) Always attach plug to the cooker first, then plug cord into the wall outlet. To disconnect,
       press Cancel, then remove plug from the wall outlet. Unplug from power outlet

Optionally, personalize pressure cooking programs as follows:
 
10 seconds after choosing the settings, the cooker beeps 3 times and displays On to 
indicate that the cooker has entered preheating cycle. If using Delay Start, the Delay 
Start light indicator will light up and 10 seconds later, the delay timer will start to count 
down. When count down is finished, cooking will start and LED will display On for the 
preheating cycle. Depending on the amount of food and its temperature, the preheating 
cycle can last from a few minutes to 40 minutes or more . As the cooker heats up and 
pressure builds, the float valve rises. When working pressure is reached, the cooker enters 
the pressure cooking cycle and displays the remaining cooking time.
When the cooking cycle has finished, the cooker beeps and 
enters the Keep Warm mode if the Auto Keep Warm function 
is turned ON. The LED displays the elapsed time (such as L0:02). 
If Cancel is not pressed, the cooker will turn OFF after 10 hours.
**Users can switch Auto Keep Warm ON/OFF, adjust pressure level and cooking time at 
any time during the cooking process. 

Pressure Cooking
Release the pressure using one of the following methods (refer to recipe):
    Natural Release: Allow the cooker to cool down naturally until the float valve drops down.
    This may take 10 to 40 minutes, or even more, depending on the amount of food in the
    cooker. Place a wet towel on the metal part of the lid to speed up cooling (do not cover the 
    steam release). 
     Quick Release: Turn the steam release handle to the Venting position to let steam out
    until the float valve drops down. Never pull out the steam release handle while releasing
    steam, as escaping steam is extremely hot and can cause scalding. When cooking food with
    large liquid volume or starch content, immediately turn the steam release handle back to
    the Sealing position at the first sign of spattering. Quick Release should ALWAYS be closely
    attended.
    
 
Press Cancel. The LED displays OFF, indicating that the cooker is in standby mode.

 • Extreme caution should be taken when moving the steam release handle to the
   Venting position. Keep hands and face away from the steam release openings. Failure
   to comply may result in scalding or serious injury.
• Do not attempt to open the lid until pressure inside the cooker is completely released. 
   As a safety feature, until the float valve drops down the lid is locked and cannot be
   opened. Do not force lid open.
• When opening the lid, the inner pot may adhere to the lid. This is caused by vacuum
  due to cooling. Make sure the steam release handle is in the Venting position and all
  the steam is released.
• If the float valve is stuck, move the steam release handle to the Venting position. Once 
  all the steam is released, push the float valve down with a pen or long utensil.
• Always add at least 18 fl oz. / 500 ml of water or other liquids so enough steam can be
   generated to cook under pressure. These include cooking sauces, wine, beer, stocks, 
   juices of fruits and vegetables. Oils, oil-based sauces and thick cooking sauces do not
   have enough water content and will not account for the required liquid volume.
• Time to pressure and cooking time will vary according to the temperature and
  quantity of the ingredients. Food that is cold or frozen will take longer to cook than food
  that is at room temperature.
• When using the Delay Start program, allow sufficient cooling down time before serving.
• The Delay Start program is not recommended for porridge, oatmeal or other foamy
  and thick liquids. Cooking progresses should be monitored when cooking these foods.
